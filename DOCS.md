# Documentation
The DOCS is basically going to have two parts: Actual documentation for using methods and such, and a breakdown of the entire project. The documentation section should be quick, just going over the methods exposed, what they do, and how to interpret their outputs, pretty much a pretty-print of the docstrings I have already written. The breakdown is the big baddie, basically working through the pipeline for a given file, the design of the loader, the custom data structure for logs, the scanner workflow, and the output file. Pretty much field notes for the designs (and maybe why some choices were made). It's just there for me and anyone looking for a 'behind the scenes'
